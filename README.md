# GPD Pocket screen rotation utility

With this utility and traybar indicator you can easily manage screen and touch rotation of your device.
You can also switch from High DPI to Normal DPI mode to work easily on attached monitors at native DPI on Xorg.

I'm experimenting other features that may be added soon.

# Install

Clone repository and run as root

    sudo ./install.sh

This will install gpdscreen rotation scripts, daemons and icons.
Reboot after install is required.

# Uninstall

Clone repository and run as root

    sudo ./uninstall.sh

This will also remove old versions of my gpdtouch scripts. 

# Credits
Base rotation script and daemons is based on initial bash work of chrisawcom
