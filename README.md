# GPD Pocket screen rotation utility

With this utility and traybar indicator you can easily manage screen and touch rotation of your device.

You can also switch from High DPI to Normal DPI mode to work easily on attached monitors at native DPI on Xorg.

I'm experimenting other features that may be added soon.
